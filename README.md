# CDCgov GitHub Organization Open Source Project Template

**Template for clearance: This project serves as a template to aid projects in starting up and moving through clearance procedures. To start, create a new repository and implement the required [open practices](open_practices.md), train on and agree to adhere to the organization's [rules of behavior](rules_of_behavior.md), and [send a request through the create repo form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=aQjnnNtg_USr6NJ2cHf8j44WSiOI6uNOvdWse4I-C2NUNk43NzMwODJTRzA4NFpCUk1RRU83RTFNVi4u) using language from this template as a Guide.**

## Overview

# This pipeline is currently under contruction and preparing for an initial alpha release.

## Introduction

`WaterGLASS` is a bioinformatics pipeline developed by CDC's [CryptoNet](https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/crypto/cryptonet.html) national surveillance program in the [Waterborne Disease Prevention Branch](https://www.cdc.gov/ncezid/dfwed/waterborne/).  This pipline QC's and de novo assembles genomes of the parasitic protist *Cryptosporidium*, automatically determines the species and subtype designation for input sequences, and calls sequence variants against a reference genome.  The pipeline accepts raw FASTQ data from Illumina short-read (shotgun) sequencing and returns a MultiQC report containing sequencing read quality metrics, taxonomic profiling of the input data, assembly and variant statistics, and specices/subtype designations.

> [!NOTE]
> **Please note that the results produced by this pipeline are not ISO or CLIA-certified and should not be considered diagnostic.**

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It uses Docker/Singularity containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible. The [Nextflow DSL2](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/dsl2.html) implementation of this pipeline uses one container per process which makes it much easier to maintain and update software dependencies. 

## Pipeline summary

The pipeline has numerous options to allow you to run only specific aspects of the workflow if you so wish. For example, for Illumina data you can skip the host read filtering step with Kraken 2 with `--skip_kraken2` or you can skip all of the assembly steps with the `--skip_assembly` parameter. See the [usage](https://nf-co.re/viralrecon/usage) and [parameter](https://nf-co.re/viralrecon/parameters) docs for all of the available options when running the pipeline.



## Credits

WaterGLASS was originally developed by [Shatavia Morrison](https://github.com/SMorrison42), [Anusha Ginni](https://github.com/aginnimb), [Krishna Thakor](https://github.com/kthakor0), and [Hunter Seabolt](https://github.com/hseabolt) as a fork of the [nf-core viralrecon pipeline](https://nf-co.re/viralrecon).  Many thanks to the viralrecon developers for providing a robust template!
